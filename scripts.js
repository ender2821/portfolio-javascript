Some tropical fruitiness; strong, fresh apple and bubble-gum notes; and more biting phenols meet in the middle, like a train wreck. Peppery and bitey yeast, with an unpleasant pithy and tannic astringency. Smacks of lager-esque sourness, under a faint lemon. Some sweet malty flavors attempt to well up amid the chaos, but they get killed halfway through. Finishes dry, with a gummy character akin to Bazooka bubble gum, and lingering phenols.",
